# King Recognition
***
King Recognition is a Deep Learning project about image recognition.
It is a demonstration code to apply algorithms and test feature engineering methods.

Kingdomino is a board game edited by Blue Orange. My project is independant from this company.

The concept of King Recognition is to automatically count the score at the end of the game from a photo of the player's 
board. Deep Learning will help us to recognise various type of lands.
